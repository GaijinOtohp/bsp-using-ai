# Biological Signal Processing using AI

This is a friendly desktop application project in C# for signal processing equipped with:  
. Signals comparator (cross correlation, minimum subtraction, dynamic time wrapping).  
. Filtering tools (Butterworth, Chebychev I, Chebychev II, DC removal, Normalization, Discrete Wavelet Transform, etc.).  
. Signal peaks analyzer (up peaks, down peaks, stable state, tangent deviation states).  
. A customized Machine learning algorithms (Deep Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor) for ECG disease detection.  
. A tool for data generation (features selection).  
. Data analysis (raw visualizatoin, Principal Component Analysis).
